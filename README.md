Taxxinn is a CA and Legal services provider company, and they manually change details of the Clients in documents for legal services for different applications. So, I had developed an executable desktop application using python as programming language and tkinter, docx are libraries supported by python and it automated the process of changing details of clients multiple times in a single document which saves lot of time.
